# 🔍 Inspector-Gadget: The Security & Exposure Detective 🕵️‍♂️

Welcome to **Inspector-Gadget**, your all-in-one cybersecurity **Swiss Army knife**! 🛡️  
This script investigates **firewall rules, container security, and network exposure**, making sure your setup isn’t **leaking secrets** like a spy with a loud mouth.  

If you ever wondered:
